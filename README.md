## What is TensorBase
TensorBase is a new big data warehousing with modern efforts.

TensorBase is building on top of Rust, Apache Arrow/DataFusion.

TensorBase hopes to change the status quo of bigdata system as follows:
  * low efficient (in the name of 'scalable')
  * hard to use (for end users) and understand (for developers)
  * not evolve with modern infrastructures (OS, hardware, engineering...)

## Features

* Out-of-the-box to play ([Get Started](/docs/get_started_developers.md) )
* Modern Engineering with Architectural Performance In Rust
* ClickHouse Compatible Syntax
* Green Installation with DBA-Free Design
* Reliability and high availability (WIP)
* Cluster (TBD)
* Cloud Neutral and Cloud Native (TBD)
* Arrow DataLake (...)
